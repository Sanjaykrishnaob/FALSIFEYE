Slide 2 – INTRODUCTION

Courts are increasingly receiving digital evidence (videos, audios, documents).
Many of these can be manipulated using AI: Deepfakes, fake voice, edited documents.
With the rise of AI-generated fake media, courts and legal professionals are facing increasing challenges in verifying the authenticity of digital evidences.
FALSIFEYE is an AI-powered platform that helps validate video, audio, image, and document-based evidence used in legal proceedings.

Slide 3 – OBJECTIVE

To detect manipulated digital evidence such as deepfake videos, cloned voices, tampered images, and forged documents.

To use AI/NLP models to analyze witness statements, identify contradictions, and verify authenticity.

To transcribe and translate multilingual audio evidence (Tamil, Hindi, etc.) using Whisper and NLP pipelines.

To generate real-time forensic PDF reports with confidence scores and visual proof for legal documentation.

To explain technical results clearly to judges/lawyers using an interactive forensic chatbot.

To integrate all modules into a single web-based dashboard for use in legal, judicial, and police environments.

Slide 4 – LITERATURE SURVEY

(Heading only; no bullet content in slide)

Slide 5 – SUMMARY OF LITERATURE

Most existing research only focuses on one type of threat at a time like detecting deepfake, voice clones, or network attacks.
But none of them give a complete solution that can check all types of digital evidence together.
Techniques like Random Forest and Ensemble Models work great for structured data (like numbers or network patterns) and can spot anomalies easily.
But they don’t work well with unstructured media like audio, video, or images which is exactly what fake legal evidence is made of.
Methods like CNNs for video and Transformers for audio help in multimedia tampering detection, but still need improvement to be accurate, fast, and easy to explain to non-technical people.
FALSIFEYE addresses these gaps by combining AI-based verification, NLP analysis, real-time alerts, multilingual support, and legal-ready PDF generation.

DESCRIPTION:
[0001] FALSIFEYE is a project that presents an AI-based platform to assist courts, lawyers, and 
investigators in evaluating the genuineness of digital evidence. With the growing use of deepfakes, 
voice cloning, doctored images, and forged documents, court systems lose faith in their visual and sound 
observations. FALSIFEYE deals with this issue by integrating different AI techniques into an accessible 
web platform. It enables users to upload various forms of evidence such as video, audio, image, or 
documents, and the system screens them for tampering marks itself without requiring multiple tools. It 
applies deepfake detection, voice cloning testing, metadata verification, and document forgery. It is also 
feasible to conduct an analysis of witness statements with NLP to search for anomalous behaviour. For 
lower courts, FALSIFEYE utilizes Whisper to transcribe audio recordings in Tamil, Hindi, or any 
language into text to be reviewable with ease. Upon culmination of analysis, a PDF-based court-ready 
report is generated with scores of authenticity, visual evidence, and a summary report. Of value is an 
interactive chatbot translating technical results into plain language. It is helpful to judges who are not 
technically competent, lawyers, as well as policemen who would want to understand why their piece of 
evidence has been highlighted. FALSIFEYE is fast, scalable, and is intended for real-time usage. For 
this reason, it is perfect for live court hearings.
PRIOR ART AND BACKGROUND:
[0002] “Deepfake Video Detection Using Ensemble CNNs” (2024) detects video forgery effectively 
but does not include audio, image, or document verification. This makes it incomplete for full case 
analysis. 
[0003] “Automated Document Forgery Detection Using ELA” (2023) reliably detects document 
tampering but works as a stand-alone tool. It requires separate workflows for video or audio evidence. 
[0004] “Voice Clone Detection Using Spectrogram Analysis” (2024) identifies synthetic voices 
effectively but does not offer multilingual transcription or court-ready reporting. 
[0005] “AI-Powered Legal Chatbots” (2025) improve access to legal resources but are not linked to 
forensic systems and cannot verify digital evidence. 
[0006] Current systems are fragmented, consume a lot of resources, and are often difficult for non￾technical users to understand. There is a strong need for a complete, easy-to-understand, and legally 
compatible platform to support digital justice systems.
OBJECTIVE:
[0007] It is a complete AI-based solution to authenticate digital evidence from various types. It includes 
deepfake detection, voice clone detection, document forgery detection, checking for metadata, and 
NLP-based statement verification within one platform. The system offers multilingual transcription to 
improve accessibility, automatically generates legally formatted forensic reports, and has a chatbot 
interface that explains findings. This makes technical results easy to understand for judges, lawyers, 
and investigators.
SUMMARY:
[0008] Digital evidence is a central component in modern legal systems and criminal justice system, 
but the new AI fakes on trial raised issues for courts struggling to confirm its credibility.
[0009] Moreover, existing forensic tools may be slow, compartmentalized and need technical 
knowledge for operation causing delays and inefficiencies.
[0010] To address these issues, this invention performs FALSIFEYE an open-source platform for video, 
audio and image ds use investigation and analysis of documents and witness testimonies from a single 
place.
[0011] Such a system detects deepfakes, voice clones and fakes through the use of AI models. It then 
refines witness testimonies through natural language processing to detect incoherence and 
contradictions.
[0012] It is also available with a multilingual transcription facility for dealing with evidence in local 
languages, thereby allowing the rural and other local courts to take advantage of the same. 
[0013] An automatic intermediate forensic report is generated with confidence values, visual indicators 
and clear ranking. Moreover, an interpretable chatbot also makes results more accessible to lay users.
[0014] The framework also emphasizes accessibility, speed and legal liability for transparency and trust 
in the digital evidence checking process.
DETAILED TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:
[0015] Evidence Pre-Processing: The uploaded files are obtained and cleaned. Videos are
divided into frames, documents’ data is subjected to OCR and audio is converted to 
spectrograms for processing.
[0016] Media Verification Layer: Deep learning models such as CNN, ELA, and spectrogram 
analysis can detect tampering in video, audio images and documents.
[0017] NLP Statement Verifier: Based verbal NLP models, it is used to find contradiction 
among sentences, analyse the sentiment and cross-verify the witness statement for truthfulness 
and coherence.
[0018] The Multilingual Transcription Layer Whisper transcribes regional audio to text for 
advanced NLP processing, supporting languages such as Tamil, Hindi etc.
[0019] Report Generation Module: This module generates structured, legally formatted PDF 
forensic reports containing authenticity score and visual evidence along with metadata 
findings. 
[0020] Explainable Chatbot Interface: It leverages GPT and Claude APIs to transform technical 
outputs into understandable explanations.
[0021] Web Dashboard: This is a centralized interface for uploading evidence, visualization of 
status, downloading reports and interaction with the chatbot.

which may be emotional cues in the testimonies.
[0024] Multi-language Transcription (103): It turns dirty, regional audio into clean text that 
analysis can be performed on it using Whisper.
[0025] Report Generator (104): Automatically generates forensically sound reports with
